# Understanding Docker: A Modern Containerization Platform
---
# Docker is more than just a buzzword—it's a game-changer for modern infrastructure. It allows you to package applications and their dependencies into lightweight, portable containers that run consistently across environments—from your laptop to production.

## What is Docker?

Docker is an open-source containerization platform that allows
developers and IT professionals to build, ship, and run applications
inside lightweight, portable containers.

In simple terms, Docker packages an application along with all its
dependencies---such as libraries, frameworks, and configuration
files---into a single unit called a container. This ensures that the
application runs consistently across different environments, from a
developer's laptop to production servers.
